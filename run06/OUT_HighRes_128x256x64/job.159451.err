slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 159451 ON hpc368 CANCELLED AT 2022-05-05T16:13:44 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[33890,0],0] on node hpc368
  Remote daemon: [[33890,0],1] on node hpc370

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
